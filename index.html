<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In the 18th century, Velu Nachiyar was one of the few women rulers who defied British rule in South India.</li>
    <li>Her use of local customs, places of worship, and community activism for organized and strategic opposition was remarkable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Background</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The year 1730 saw the birth of Velu Nachiyar, the daughter of Ramnad's royal family. Due to the absence of a male heir, she was raised like a princely child.</li>
    <li>She was trained in military strategy, combat, and horse riding, and was fluent in languages such as Urdu, English, and some French.</li>
    <li>After her marriage to Muthu Vaduganatha Thevar, she became the Queen of Sivaganga and actively participated in administration and military leadership.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Loss</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In 1772, Sivaganga was attacked by British forces in alliance with the Nawab of Arcot.</li>
    <li>Her husband was killed during a raid at the Kalaiyarkovil temple, which was also looted and destroyed.</li>
    <li>Velu Nachiyar was forced to flee with her daughter, while Sivaganga was occupied and renamed Hussainnagar.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vengeance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>During eight years of exile, Velu Nachiyar built intelligence networks, allied with Haidar Ali, and trained a women’s army known as the Udaiyal Padai.</li>
    <li>Her forces infiltrated Sivaganga by disguising themselves as devotees during the Vijayadashami festival.</li>
    <li>Sivaganga was recaptured after her commander, Kuyili, sacrificed her life by destroying the British ammunition store.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Velu Nachiyar became the first Indian queen to successfully reclaim her kingdom from the British.</li>
    <li>She appointed the Marudhu brothers as chief minister and military commander while ruling on behalf of her daughter.</li>
    <li>Her resistance influenced later anti-British movements, including the Poligar Wars in South India.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why People Forgot About Her</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Early anti-British uprisings by regional rulers were overshadowed by later national movements.</li>
    <li>Colonial records minimized indigenous resistance, and women leaders received limited recognition.</li>
    <li>Her story survived mainly through local worship, folk ballads, and oral traditions rather than mainstream history.</li>
</ul>
